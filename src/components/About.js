        <p>
          Hi, I'm Nitya GV, a web developer in college with a passion for building user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I'm still learning, but I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects.
          I am adept with a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I'm also learning about back-end development and databases. 
          I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I'm also excited to collaborate with other developers and learn from their experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to build elegant, and efficient web applications that meet my clients' needs. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, or enjoying a range of books.
        </p>
